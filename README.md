**NFT messaging for ethereum accounts**
From a website, a user will input a message they'd like to send to an account.
The website will convert that text into an image.
That image will be uploaded as an NFT on opensea.
That NFT will then be sent to the address that the user would like to message.
Possibly include a check to make suare the receiver address has interacted with opensea or some other open NFT platform before.
